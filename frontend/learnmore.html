            <h3>Tackling fitting and sizing challenges for all body types</h3>
            <p>Accurate size recommendations
                Our virtual fitting room plugs into your online store and shoppers can create an avatar with basic measurements and body shape selections. Our solution is size inclusive and the fit recommendation engine maps garment patterns and sizes to your customers’ unique measurements, allowing them to find their perfect fit and size.</p>
            <p>Find your fit
                Accurate sizing helps to reduce returns and prevent bracketing, which is buying an item in different sizes as the shoppers are uncertain which one will fit. Having the opportunity to “try-before-you-buy” online with a personalized size recommendation helps to reduce returns and increase conversions.</p>
